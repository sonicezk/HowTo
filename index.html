  <p style="font-family:verdana">    Nowadays, many people see bass as the instrument that's <q>only there to support
  the guitars</q> in music. When people look at a band, it's often rare if not unheard of that they look 
  at the bassist and describe that person as the main member of the band that others would focus on. 
  Although this is often the case in modern times, without bass music wouldn't sound the same.
  There are many ways to make bass interesting, and without it modern music would be lost.

  <h3 style="font-family:verdana"><i>Why bass?</i></h3>
  <!-- Used the bold in this paragraph to emphasize "large number"-->
  <p style="font-family:verdana">Contrary to popular belief, bass has an incredibly high amount of
  combinations you can make with its notes. With guitar, there are obviously the normal chords that
  are present and allow music to be played properly. As for bass, there are a <b>large number</b> of things you
  can do to change things up. Whether a requirement for some or a waste of money to others, there are
  things such as guitar pedals that work on bass. These can change the sounds of the bass from the amp,
  which can drastically affect the end-result and make it sound more to your liking. Often, these
  pedals can be found online at websites such as <a href="http://www.guitarcenter.com/" target="_blank" style="color:white">Guitar Center.</a></p>
  <p style="font-family:verdana">In addition to modifying add-ons like pedals, there are also a
  number of ways to play bass that'll change how it sounds. The most typical playstyle is with your index and
  middle finger back and forth on the strings, but there's other methods such as using a pick, which could
  give it more of a rough and plucky sound, or my personal favorite, slap. Slap playing involves using your
  thumb to hit the string you want to play, giving it a plucky, rough, surprising sound that's usually 
  different from what you'd hear in modern times.</p>
  <p style="font-family:verdana">In using bass, another major factor of the sound is what
  type of amp you buy. When thinking about what amp to buy, there's a couple key companies that you could
  buy from. The biggest and most trusted companies would be:
  <!-- Used this part of the paragraph to sneak in the unordered list, includes <ul> and <li>-->
  <ul style="list-style-type:square">
    <li>Fender</li>
    <li>Orange</li>
    <li>Kramer</li>
  </ul></p>
  <p style="font-family:verdana">Those are the most trusted and common brands for amplifiers,
  but there are many more out there available for purchase. Often times they require personal opinion on
  what ones are considered "best", but either way they make a large difference as to what the sound of the
  bass instrument you play will be.</p>
  <h3 style="color:font-family:verdana"><i>Conclusion</i></h3>
  <p style="color:font-family:verdana">Although it's commonly seen as the back-up instrument that
  lacks a playstyle, bass is highly necessary in modern music. With its many combinations, ways to modify the
  sounds that come out of the amp by either pedal or amp itself, or its many ways to play, it can be a highly
  varying instrument with many different ways to enjoy it. As for most things in life though, beauty lies in 
  the eyes of the beholder, and taking the time to learn the beauty of bass is undoubtedly worth it to any aspiring
  musicians in the world.</p>
